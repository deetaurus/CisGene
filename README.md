IMPLEMENTATION OF CIS-GENE REGULATION IN GENETIC ASSIMILATION
  
  The project develops a genetic algorithm-based approach for the representation of cis- regulatory element acting upon the genetic assimilation in various generations of a population. Using a computational model of string-like gaploid genotypes, whether phenotypic plasticity can speed up evolution is verfied. The real-life situation was real- ized by Waddington in experiments carried out on the fruit fly Drosophilia. He showed that an acquired trait could eventually become inherited. The essential assumption in our model is that a structural gene can be in either of three allelic states viz., ’on’ or ’o ’ or ’in a plastic state’ and the regulatory gene can be in either of two allelic states viz., ’on’ or ’o ’.
